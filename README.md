### Making sense out of data bit by bit

I translate complex information into structured, interoperable data platforms for biotech and business use. 

Through Quantome SAS, a company I founded in Paris, I have written and maintain over 100 Go command-line applications in my GitLab proprietary repositories. I have also developed software in C and C++. I use Python for AI, and early in my career, I learned how to program in Java, Pascal, and Fortran.

Currently, I am navigating a dense technology transfer process to transform some of my proprietary software into open-source products and services. I look forward to sharing these developments soon.
